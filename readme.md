SudoRunespan by Deprecated for the RSBot botting client.

To add this script to RSBot:

1) SDN
  Add it to your SDN list from http://www.powerbot.org/scripts/

2) Source files
  If you have an IDE it may just be easier to pull my project into your IDE.
  Make sure to have the latest RSBot as a library and set up the program
  arguments with the -dev flag.  SudoRunespan should show up in the script loader.
